# Parquet-converter
Convert Parquet files to HTML JSON or CSV very easy

Please ensure that you have the pyarrow or fastparquet engine installed in your Python environment, as they are required for the pd.read_parquet() method. If not, you can install either of them using pip: pip install pyarrow or pip install fastparquet.
